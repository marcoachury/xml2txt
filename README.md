# xml2txt
Extract plain text from XLM file.  I made it to rescue text from corrupted MS Word docx files.

docx files are really a set of files on a zip compressed archived.

Use your favorite zip utility to extract the file document.xml.  May be easier you may rename you .docx files to .zip

I hope is usefull for you.
